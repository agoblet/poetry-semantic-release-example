# semantic-release-example

Example semantic release system. 
Inspired by a [blog](https://devpress.csdn.net/cicd/62eca57d89d9027116a11693.html#devmenu6) by [MeStrak](https://github.com/MeStrak).
Uses:
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) as the commit message specification
- [Semantic PR](https://github.com/Ezard/semantic-prs) to enforce semantic PR titles
- [semantic-release-action](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action) to automatically create new Github releases based on commit messages
